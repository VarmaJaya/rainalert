This code fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specified location and checks if it's going to rain based on weather conditions. If rain is detected, it sends an SMS alert via Twilio to remind the user to bring an umbrella.

Key Steps:
1. Weather API Call: It retrieves the weather forecast using the provided latitude, longitude, and API key.
2. Rain Check: The code checks if any weather conditions indicate rain (IDs less than 700).
3. SMS Alert: If rain is detected, the Twilio API sends an SMS notification to the specified number.
